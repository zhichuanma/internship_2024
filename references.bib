 abstract = {The global warming issue with its resulting climate disturbances is a burning topic. The European Union is seeking, with its Climate Law, to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In this context, energy models are needed to study possible future energy systems that best meet these objectives. Many models exist, but no model encompassing the different facets of the energy sector - electricity, heat and mobility - allows a multi-criteria optimisation of the studied energy system. However, given the challenges associated with the energy transition, it is crucial to be able to assess a system from different, sometimes contradictory, aspects: economic, environmental, technical and social. The present work proposes the implementation of a multi-criteria approach in the EnergyScope TD model, which is currently single objective, but which has the following advantages: integration of all sectors of the energy system, open source, reasonable computation time and possibility of fine temporal resolution, which is necessary to take into account the fluctuating character of renewable energies. In order to achieve a multi-criteria optimisation, key performance indicators were selected that allow for an economic, environmental and societal view and, in order to provide as global a perspective as possible on the energy system under consideration, additional criteria were introduced. For data collection, we followed a "life cycle assessment" approach that takes into account the entire life cycle of the processes involved in the evaluation of the associated impacts. In this task, with the help of SimaPro software, we made extensive use of the ecoinvent database. The application case selected is Belgium in the year 2035. The multi-criteria optimisation allows to obtain a mapping of the technologies to be implemented and the analysis highlights the environmental impacts of the energy system according to the weight associated to each criterion. Finally, a more targeted study of a low-carbon Belgian energy system is carried out. The findings of this case study are likely to be transposable to other countries.},

abstract = {Due to the imperative nature of addressing climate change, the energy transition is currently underway, prompting the recognition of its urgency. Energy system optimisation models have emerged as crucial tools to assist policymakers in formulating laws and regulations that facilitate the transition towards carbon neutrality. While numerous models have been developed to explore various scenarios and define long-term objectives, only a few models focus on optimising the specific pathway to achieve these objectives. Many existing models lack the necessary time resolution to capture the integration of intermittent renewable energies; or are not open-source, creating a challenge in terms of transparency and reproducibility. This paper introduces EnergyScope Pathway, an open-source and documented model that addresses these limitations. It specifically optimises investment strategies for the whole-energy system over a 30-year period, or more, and optimising its hourly operation. This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the effective integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. The model has a concise and efficient formulation, enabling its execution on personal laptops within approximately 15 min. By applying the model to the case study of Belgium, which presents challenges due to limited potential for renewable energy, we illustrate the importance of four pillars: energy efficiency, renewable energies, sector coupling, electrification and imports. The result pave the way to a new and incremental tool to support decision makers. In comparison to non open-source models, we verified the model’s results with similar studies and found consistency in terms of technico-economic estimations.}

abstract = {The transition towards more sustainable, fossil-free energy systems is interlinked with a high penetration of stochastic renewables, such as wind and solar. Integrating these new energy resources and technologies will lead to profound structural changes in energy systems, such as an increasing need for storage and a radical electrification of the heating and mobility sectors. To capture the increasing complexity of such future energy systems, new flexible and open-source optimization modelling tools are needed. This paper presents EnergyScope TD, a novel open-source model for the strategic energy planning of urban and regional energy systems. Compared to other existing energy models, which are often proprietary, computationally expensive and mostly focused on the electricity sector, EnergyScope TD optimises both the investment and operating strategy of an entire energy system (including electricity, heating and mobility). Additionally, its hourly resolution (using typical days) makes the model suitable for the integration of intermittent renewables, and its concise mathematical formulation and computational efficiency are appropriate for uncertainty applications. We present the linear programming model, detailing its formulation, and we apply it to a real-world case study to discuss advantages and disadvantages in comparison to other modelling frameworks. In particular, we model the national energy system of Switzerland to evaluate a 50% renewable energy scenario.}

      abstract = {The Paris agreement is the first-ever universally accepted  and legally binding agreement on global climate change. It  is a bridge between today’s and climate-neutrality  policies and strategies before the end of the century.  However, government and private companies still struggle to  develop cost-effective carbon-neutral strategies. Energy  system modeling has proved essential in creating strategies  to generate carbon-neutral scenarios under minimal costs.  However, cost minimization does not necessarily lead to  publicly acceptable solutions nor generate configura- tions  that minimize environmental impacts. Here we show a  methodology to integrate LCIA indicators in an energy  system model, assessing the impact of energy system  configurations on economic and environmental aspects. Here  we show a methodology to integrate life cycle assessment  metrics in an energy system model to account for (i)  emissions and impacts beyond the operation of the energy  system itself and (ii) identify configurations optimizing  both economic and environmental aspects. The model is  applied to the case study of Switzerland and shows that  with little modifications to the energy system  configuration, carbon neutrality can be reached under the  cost minimization objective while identifying trade-offs  with other environmental issues. This work allows the  generation of MOO of energy systems, minimizing burden  shifting of environmental impacts and generating robust  solutions for the energy transition, increasing social  acceptance towards the biggest challenge of the 21st  century.},
